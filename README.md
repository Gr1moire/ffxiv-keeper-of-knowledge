A simple lorefinder for FFXIV working with XIVAPI, built with Flutter Web. Work in progress!

## Run the application

Assuming Flutter is already installed, you need to use latest version from the Beta channel, and to enable web support.
```
$ flutter channel beta
$ flutter upgrade
$ flutter config --enable-web
```
You can then run the application from localhost, it only works with Google Chrome at the moment.
```
$ flutter run -d chrome
```
